#  Text Summarizer using NLP & Transformers

This project focuses on building an **abstractive text summarizer** using **PEGASUS**, a state-of-the-art transformer model developed by Google for summarization tasks. The goal is to automatically generate short, coherent, and meaningful summaries of longer text documents.

##  Features

- Abstractive text summarization using **PEGASUS** transformer model.
- Preprocessing using NLP techniques: tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization.
- Model trained and tested on the **CNN/DailyMail** dataset.
- Easy-to-understand implementation with clear step-by-step Jupyter Notebook.
- Performance evaluation using ROUGE scores.
- Reduces manual summarization time by **~60%**.
